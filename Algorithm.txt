Question:Disk Backed Map Collection:

Implement a Map, which spills on to disk when it exceeds the heap, or a specified limit.
oTime Complexity should be same as Current NavigableMap implementations (eg: TreeMap)
oShould be capable of handling in a multithreaded environment. 
oput() and get() operations, should be Thread Safe.
oShould be Serializable to disk
Should provide API level Tuning configurations, Where ever applicable.

Answer:
Algorithm:
i)first to create a OutOfMemory Error using put command insert huge data in the Map Data structure and surround it with try-catch.
ii)When OutOfMemory Error occurs the control is transferred in catch block.
iii)The process of serialiaztion is done to write the data that spills heap memory to disk using Object Output Stream.
iv)Then desrializing also takes place simultaneously using thread concept.
v)The data is printed on screen.
Note:Collections.synchronized is used to make put and get method thread safe.
